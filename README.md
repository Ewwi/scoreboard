# Live Football World Cup Scoreboard

The **Live Football World Cup Scoreboard** is a straightforward library designed to provide real-time summaries of football matches. This scoreboard enables users to manage and track matches seamlessly with the following features:

## Features

1. **Start a New Match**: Begin a new match with an initial score of 0-0. This operation requires the following parameters:
   - **Home Team**
   - **Away Team**

2. **Update Score**: Modify the score of an ongoing match by providing the absolute scores for both the home and away teams.

3. **Finish Match**: Conclude a match currently in progress, which will remove it from the scoreboard.

4. **Get Match Summary**: Retrieve a summary of matches that are currently in progress, sorted by total score. Matches with the same total score will be ordered by their most recent start time.

## Git Log

To facilitate an easy review process, I have maintained a structured commit history with RED, GREEN, BLUE commits. This approach allows reviewers to track the progress of the work effectively, as opposed to squashing the commits.
